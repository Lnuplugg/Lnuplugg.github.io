## Compare to regular CSS
The use of variables makes it more flexible because one wouldn't have to repeat code as much.
It's easier and more flexible when the CSS code is separated in multiple files instead of one big document.

## Which techniques did you use?
In this project the variables mostly controlled colors and fonts in the minima.scss document which i changed.
Changed different calculations(headings,fonts etc.) which didn't fit when i modified the theme.

## Pros and cons?
Advantages: Variables, joining multiple files, mixins, DRY.
Disanvantages: Debugging, Compilation time.
