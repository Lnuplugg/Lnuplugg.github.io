## What do you think of static site generators?
+Relatively lightweight compared to something like wordpress.
+No database, scalability and easier caching of the content are some of the good things.

-Learning curve.

Static site generators are suitable for projects that dont require databases and advanced user interaction.
Sites that dont need to be updated very often.
Some examples could include landing pages, blogs, kickstarters etc.
