&lt;p&gt;The pupose of the robots.txt file is to tell the search engine crawlers and other webcrawlers
what files and folders they should avoid or follow. 
For example disallow crawling to login/admin pages to
avoid them being indexed in the search engines(might still happen). I have used â€œDisallow: /â€ which tells all crawlers
to avoid crawling the entire site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-humanstxt-and-how-have-you-configured-it-for-your-site&quot;&gt;What is humans.txt and how have you configured it for your site?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created it like with the robots.txt file, all lower case and in UTF-8.
Added the base template from humans.txt.org and added some parts and removed others that didnâ€™t the description of the project.
For example added the standards and software used in the creation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-you-implement-comments-to-blog-posts&quot;&gt;How did you implement comments to blog posts?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used Disqus and the code provided in their website. I created a seperate file in _includes and minima theme already had a â€œif blockâ€ to handle the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-open-graph-and-how-do-you-make-use-of-it&quot;&gt;What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the The Open Graph protocol. I added a separate html file in the _includes folder with the code from the website specifically made for Jekyll.
Then checked the source code that everything was correct. I used type, image, description, site name, url.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mikael</name></author><summary type="html">What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?

&lt;p&gt;The use of variables makes it more flexible because one wouldnâ€™t have to repeat code as much.
Itâ€™s easier and more flexible when the CSS code is separated in multiple files instead of one big document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;which-techniques-did-you-use&quot;&gt;Which techniques did you use?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project the variables mostly controlled colors and fonts in the minima.scss document which i changed.
Changed different calculations(headings,fonts etc.) which didnâ€™t fit when i modified the theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pros-and-cons&quot;&gt;Pros and cons?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advantages: Variables, joining multiple files, mixins, DRY.
Disanvantages: Debugging, Compilation time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mikael</name></author><summary type="html">Compare to regular CSS The use of variables makes it more flexible because one wouldnâ€™t have to repeat code as much.

&lt;p&gt;+Relatively lightweight compared to something like wordpress.
+No database, scalability and easier caching of the content are some of the good things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static site generators are suitable for projects that dont require databases and advanced user interaction.
Sites that dont need to be updated very often.
Some examples could include landing pages, blogs, kickstarters etc.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mikael</name></author><summary type="html">What do you think of static site generators? +Relatively lightweight compared to something like wordpress. +No database, scalability and easier caching of the content are some of the good things.</summary></entry></feed>
